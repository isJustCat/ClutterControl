# ClutterControl (working title)

## 'xcuse me?
This cat got slightly annoyed looking for a personal inventory management system to use.
It tried deploying [Homebox](https://github.com/sysadminsmedia/homebox) but sort of failed and then went with [snipe-it](https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it) but didn't like the overhead.

We think our inventory management should be dead simple.  
Actually, a spreadsheet can do the job just fine.  
But this unit likes having a dashboard, or as many as it wants, an API to do shenanigans with...  
There's *Creatures*, which have some relation to *items* across multiple *locations* and everything can have a bunch of *properties*.  
They are identified by some number, they can have a name, a description, and n attributes.  
Sometimes some *changes* are done to the stuff we want to keep track of, or to the locations we have stuff lying around. They are defined by an *action* and a *date*.  


## Oh, that sounds cool! How can one contribute?
The reader is very much invited to reach out to this one, either by just opening an issue and dumping some thoughts, or via one of the channels mentioned below. Thinking about software [that we want to use] is fun, and hearing others' thoughts (or getting feedback on our code) is nice :3
