# ClutterControl (working title)

## 'xcuse me?
This cat got slightly annoyed looking for a personal inventory management system to use.
It tried deploying [Homebox](https://github.com/sysadminsmedia/homebox) but for some reason it didn't work to just translate the docker stuff into a kubernetes deployment (Well, the app was running but register/login was not possible and the log wasn't really telling it much...)

Long story short, it ended up with the intention of creating yet another inventory management software.

The reader is looking at what aims to become the server/base part of this thingamajig.

## Oh, that sounds cool! How can one contribute?
The reader is very much invited to reach out to this one, either by just opening an issue and dumping some thoughts, or via one o the channels mentioned below.

Pull requests are also veryy much appreciated. Honestly, this unit is more of a DevOps girl than a software developer... ><
